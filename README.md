<!-- BUILDING -->

## Building

Turtle is gradually changing its structure to a monorepo handled by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build)

### First things first

`.env` files are local to the packages

In the root of the project run: 

`pnpm install`

### How do I build and start the project

`pnpm run build` or `pnpm run build --filter=<package-name>`

then running the following command will serve what you've just built.

`pnpm run start` or `pnpm run start --filter=<package-name>`

### How do I run dev?

`pnpm run dev` or `pnpm run dev --filter=<package-name>`

`package-name` is always the name that's used in the `name` field of a `package.json`

### How do I add a package?

Packages can be added from the root directory but it's very important that a `filter` is specified, 
as we do not want to add anything to the main `package.json` unless necessary for monorepo purposes.

`pnpm add <package> --filter=<package-name>`
