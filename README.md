<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Turtle is your go to app when it comes to cross-chain transfers that leverage fully trustless infrastructure. We aim to provide a unified experience to transfer tokens anywhere.

Features:

- Make transfers between blockchains in a decentralized and trustless way. With a mind blowing UI.
- Powered by Snowbridge. Transfer ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and Polkadot.
- Soon to be added: Asset Transfer API support. Transfer tokens seamlessly between all parachains.

<br/>
Turtle was developed with Typescript, Nextjs, and React.
