# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## 📦 Releasing a new version of @velocitylabs-org/turtle-widget

To publish a new version of the widget package to NPM, follow these steps:

### 🔧 1. Install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### ⚙️ 2. Build the widget

```
pnpm run build
```

### ✅ 3. Lint and validate

```
pnpm run lint
```

### ✍️ 4. Create a changeset

```
pnpm run changeset
```

- Select `@velocitylabs-org/turtle-widget`
- Choose the version bump: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`
- Write a short summary for the changelog

_This creates a `.changeset/` file that describes the release._

### 📝 5. Apply the version bump

```
pnpm run changeset version
```

This updates:

- `package.json` with the new version
- `CHANGELOG.md` with the summary
- Deletes the processed `.changeset/` file

### 🚀 6. Publish to NPM

```
pnpm run changeset publish
```

This operation may require a one-time password from your authenticator. If prompted, enter your one-time password from your 2FA device

The release will be published under the `latest` tag (stable)

_📘 Documentation for releasing alpha or next pre-release versions will be added soon._
